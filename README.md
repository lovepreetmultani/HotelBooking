Overview of the objectives

The objective is for you to build an API to manage Booking.com Hotels, from dealing with inventory queries to searching for the best hotel for a customer.

A /hotel GET endpoint, listing all the hotels in our system.

An H2 in-memory data source containing all our hotel inventory.

Service implementation layer to retrieve information from the hotel and city inventory.

Example implementations of functional tests (testing a bit of logic) and integration tests (testing an HTTP endpoint in your API).
